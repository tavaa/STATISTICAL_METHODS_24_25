# STATISTICAL_METHODS_24_25

This repository contains materials for the **Statistical Methods** course for the academic year 2024-2025. This course is offered by UniTS (Università degli Studi di Trieste), Trieste, Italy.

---

## Repository Structure

- **Homework Projects**: Three sets of exercises implemented in **R**, covering the entire program of the course.
- **Final Project**: A **Python-based** flight fare prediction project, demonstrating the application of statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

## Contents

### 1. Homework Projects (R)
- **HW1**: [Mainly focused on Hyphothesis testing and Statistical Inference]
- **HW2**: [Linear, Poisson, Logistic Regression]
- **HW3**: [Bayesian Inference, GAM models and Ensemble Methods]

Each homework project focuses on specific statistical methods and includes:
- Data analysis and visualization.
- Hypothesis testing.
- Regression models.
- Other advanced techniques covered in the course.

### 2. Final Project (Python)
- **Flight Fare Prediction**: A comprehensive project predicting flight fares using statistical and machine learning methods.
  - **Dataset**: [Flight Fare Prediction]
  - **Methods**: Linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and other relevant techniques.
  - **Evaluation**: Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.
