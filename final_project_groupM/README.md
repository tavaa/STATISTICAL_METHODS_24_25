## Introduction

This **advanced analysis** focuses on a dataset of internal flights, aiming to uncover insights and build predictive models. The study begins with an exploratory data analysis to examine the descriptive characteristics of the dataset, such as distributions, trends, and correlations among key variables like flight duration, departure time, and fare prices. Then, multiple regression techniques will be applied, including *linear regression* to assess linear relationships, *polynomial regression* to capture non-linear patterns, and *random forest models* for robust and flexible predictions. Additional advanced analysis will involve evaluating model performance using metrics such as *AIC*, *BIC*, *RMSE*, *MAE* and *$R^2$*. This comprehensive approach aims to provide actionable insights and accurate models for predicting flight fares and understanding influential factors.

**Goal**: The purpose of this analysis is to predict the quantitative variable *price* (response), focusing on identifying key factors that influence it and building accurate predictive models to estimate flight fares.
